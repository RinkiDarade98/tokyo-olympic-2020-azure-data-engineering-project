# tokyo-olympic-2021-azure-data-engineering-project

This is an end to end azure data engineering project. The goal of this project was to create a data pipeline that ingests, transforms, stores, analyses the tokyo olympic 2020 dataset using various azure services.
In this project I have used Azure Data Factory to extract the data from data source and then load that raw data into Data Lake Gen 2 container.
Then performed some transformations on raw data using Azure Databricks. Again I have loaded the transformed data back to transformed Data Lake Storage. And analysed the data using SQL on Azure Synapse Analytics.
